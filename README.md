# Seven-different-cpp-Codes
There are seven cpp codes here
 
 //Note: programs are going to end when you enter negative number
 
1-CheckAssendingandDesending.cpp Check assending and desending order of a sequence and ouput if no is in sequence or not 
e.g input: 1,2,3 ,-1
output: in order


2-CheckInputNos'60above.cpp check input nos' half is greater than 60 or not 
e.g input: 60,70,10,20,-1
output: half is above 60


3-ComputingResultOfFormula.cpp just compute the result of formula composition.
input is n and r 


4-EqAnswerComparison.cpp have quadratic eq that  computes its greater value than input value
e.g suppose you enter 60 and eq gives 61 at x=5 so it's ouput x=5 


5-MaximumTriple.cpp gives group of 3 nos' that are greater in the given nos' 
e.g 12,13,14,15,16,17,-1
so output: 15, 16 ,17 


6-MostrepeatedNo.cpp give most repeated no in the input
e.g : 1,2,3,4,4,4,4,4,5,5,6,7,-1
so output is 4



7- SeqenceDetector.cpp detect sequence you can modify code little bit 
sequence  =   *702 -1
